# Daywise Sticky Notes App

A lightweight, browser-based note-taking application designed to help manage daily tasks across academics, project development, and personal planning. Built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, the app provides a clean and responsive interface without requiring any login or backend server.

---

## **Problem Statement**
Managing project tasks, academic notes, and development activities across different platforms became difficult and inconsistent. Existing digital note tools often require login, store data in the cloud, or lack proper mobile responsiveness.

This project was created to tackle these challenges by offering a simple, fast, and secure note-taking experience—right inside the browser.

---

## **Features**
- **Day-wise Note Creation**: Add and manage notes specific to any date.
- **Sticky Notes UI**: Clean, color-coded note cards resembling real sticky notes.
- **Progress Tracking**: Mark notes as *To Do*, *In Progress*, or *Done*.
- **Clipboard Support**: Copy or paste text directly into notes.
- **Download Notes**: Export notes by progress or selection in JSON or TXT format.
- **Local Storage Persistence**: Notes are saved automatically in the browser; no login required.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully optimized for both mobile and desktop.
- **Edit & Delete Notes**: Modify or remove notes with ease.
- **Bulk Actions**: Select multiple notes for downloading or clearing.

## **Tech Stack**
- **HTML5** – Structure of the interface
- **CSS3** – Styling, gradients, responsiveness
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** – Logic, localStorage, DOM operations

---

## **How It Works**
1. Select a date at the top of the interface.
2. Add a title, content, color, and progress status.
3. Notes appear instantly on the right-side grid.
4. Use filters to view notes by progress.
5. Use copy, edit, delete, and selection actions as needed.
6. Export selected or filtered notes.
7. All data stays locally inside your browser.

## **Why I Built This Project**
This app was created as part of my **100 Days Project-Making Challenge (Day 25)**. I often struggled to maintain consistent notes for:
- Academic work
- Daily development tasks
- Long-term project planning

Instead of using multiple tools, I decided to build a solution tailored to my personal workflow—lightweight, fast, responsive, and login-free.
